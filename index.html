      <p>Older adults know they answer a lot of questions at the doctor’s office about their physical, emotional and
        cognitive fitness. It’s standard fare for all annual wellness visits. But doctors also glean important
        information about your health and well-being when you ask questions, too.</p>

        <p>That’s why Dr. John Card urges patients who are 65 and older to feel free to ask about any concerns that come
          to mind — anytime you visit. Your questions not only reveal your health concerns but also insight into your
          plans and goals for this stage of life.
          <br><br>
          "You’ve worked all these years and this is the time to at least enjoy all that you’ve worked for.
          "Unfortunately, as we get older, sometimes that’s when problems start to develop."
          <br><br> Card suggests older patients prepare for scheduled visits in advance. He recommends jotting down
          questions as they arise and taking them to your appointment. No question is too big, too small or too
          personal, though it might take time or technology to work through some.

    <p>A simple mnemonic — 3M — can guide your thinking as you consider what to ask your health care provider about. It
      stands for medications, memory and mobility.</p>

      <p>Nearly a third of older Americans visit at least five different doctors a year, according to <a class="p-link"
          target=”_blank”
          href="https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2021-11-02/almost-1-in-3-us-seniors-now-sees-at-least-5-doctors-per-year#:~:text=Nov.%202%2C%202021%2C%20at%208%3A25%20a.m.&text=TUESDAY%2C%20Nov.%202%2C%202021,care%2C%20a%20new%20study%20finds.">a
          recent study</a>, and it’s the job of primary care doctors like Card to coordinate that care. Managing
        medications is a key part of that. So take along all prescription medicines — and any dietary supplements you
        use — for a thorough review.
        <br><br>
        "Sometimes we get to a point where older patients are starting to get light-headed, they’re starting to get
        weak, they’re not eating as much and are starting to lose weight, and they may not need all of the medications
        that they were taking before," Card said.

        <ul>
          <li>Which, if any, of my medicines can be eliminated?</li>
          <li>Am I getting the right doses and taking them properly?</li>
          <li>Am I at risk for dangerous drug interactions?</li>
          <li>Are any of my supplements interfering with my medicine? (Be sure to check with your provider before

      <h1>Memory</h1>
      <hr>
      <hr>
      <p>As you age, you may feel forgetful or confused at times — or friends and family may raise concerns about this.
        Asking your provider what’s to be expected at your age and what’s concerning can allay fears or start a
        conversation about the future. At the same time, don’t make the mistake of thinking simple forgetfulness is a
        sign of a deeper problem. More often than not, it’s not.</p>
      <br><br>
      <h2>Suggested questions:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Is what I’m experiencing something to worry about?</li>
        <li>Could my diet or medication be causing memory lapses?</li>
        <li>Is something wrong if I forget to pay a bill or overdraw my checking account from time to time?</li>
        <li>What are some ways to compensate for occasional absent-mindedness?</li>
        <li>Do my memory and thinking skills need to be formally evaluated?</li>

      <h1>Mobility</h1>
      <hr>
      <hr>
      <p>Besides memory, an older person’s ability to navigate their living environment safely is key to his or her
        ability to live independently. Your doctor will ask about this often — and so should you.</p>
      <br><br>
      <h2>Suggested questions:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>How can I prevent falls? Is it safe for me to climb stairs?</li>
        <li>Do I need aids like grab bars, toilet chairs, a walker, stair lift or a device that summons help if I fall?
        </li>
        <li>What can I do to stay strong and flexible?</li>
        <li>What are some ways to compensate for occasional absent-mindedness?</li>
        <li>How will I know it’s time to think about assisted living?</li>
